//All we eat is water and dry matter.
//
//John bought potatoes: their weight is 100 kilograms. Potatoes contain water and dry matter.
//
//The water content is 99 percent of the total weight. He thinks they are too wet and puts them in an oven - at low temperature - for them to lose some water.
//
//At the output the water content is only 98%.
//
//What is the total weight in kilograms (water content plus dry matter) coming out of the oven?
//
//He finds 50 kilograms and he thinks he made a mistake: "So much weight lost for such a small change in water content!"
//
//Can you help him?
//
//Write function potatoes with
//
//int parameter p0 - initial percent of water-
//int parameter w0 - initial weight -
//int parameter p1 - final percent of water -
//potatoesshould return the final weight coming out of the oven w1 truncated as an int.
//
//Example:
//
//potatoes(99, 100, 98) --> 50

import Foundation

class DryingPotatoes {
    func potatoes (_ p0: Int, _ w0: Int, _ p1: Int) -> Int {
//        Solution 2
        return w0 * (100 - p0) / (100 - p1)
        
//        Solution 1
//        let p00 = 1 - Decimal(p0) / 100.0
//        let p11 = 1 - Decimal(p1) / 100.0
//        let w00 = Decimal(w0)
//        return Int.init(truncating: NSDecimalNumber(decimal: w00 * p00 / p11))
    }
}
